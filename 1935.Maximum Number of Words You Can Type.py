        Count words typable given broken letters â€” set membership filtering.

        Intuition:
        A word becomes untypable if it contains any broken letter. Thus, filter words with no characters from the broken set.

        Approach:
        - Build a set from brokenLetters for O(1) membership checks.
        - Split the text into words on whitespace.
        - For each word, ensure every character is not in the broken set.
        - Count words that pass the check.

        Complexity:
        Time: O(N), where N is the total number of characters in text.
        Space: O(B), for the set of broken letters (B <= alphabet size).
