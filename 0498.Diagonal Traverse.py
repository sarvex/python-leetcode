        """Diagonal traversal with alternating reversal

        Intuition:
        Traverse the matrix by enumerating each diagonal (constant i+j). Elements on
        the same diagonal can be collected by moving down-left. To match the zigzag
        order, reverse every even-indexed diagonal.

        Approach:
        - There are m+n-1 diagonals indexed by d in [0, m+n-2].
        - For each d, start at row=max(0, d-(n-1)) and col=min(d, n-1), move while
          within bounds collecting values.
        - Reverse the collected list when d is even, then append to the result.

        Complexity:
        - Time: O(m*n) â€” each cell is visited exactly once.
        - Space: O(1) extra (excluding output), O(min(m,n)) temporary per diagonal.
