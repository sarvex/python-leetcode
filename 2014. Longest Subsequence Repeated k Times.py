        BFS with pruning: Find the longest subsequence that appears exactly k times.

        Intuition:
        Use BFS to explore all possible subsequences, starting from the shortest ones.
        Only consider characters that appear at least k times in the original string.

        Approach:
        1. Count frequency of each character and keep only those appearing â‰¥ k times
        2. Use BFS to generate candidate subsequences in decreasing lexicographical order
        3. For each candidate, check if it appears exactly k times as a subsequence
        4. Return the longest valid subsequence found

        Complexity:
        Time: O(n * 26^l) where n is the length of s and l is the length of the answer
        Space: O(26^l) for the queue
