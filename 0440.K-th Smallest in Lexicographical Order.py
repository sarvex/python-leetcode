        """Denary tree traversal to find the k-th lexicographically smallest number.

        Intuition:
            Numbers in lexicographical order form a denary tree (10-ary tree) where each
            node has up to 10 children (0-9). We can count how many numbers are in each
            subtree and use this to navigate to the k-th number efficiently.

        Approach:
            1. Start from the smallest digit (1)
            2. For each current number, calculate how many numbers are in its subtree
            3. If k is greater than the count, move horizontally (curr + 1)
            4. Otherwise, move down the tree (curr * 10) and decrease k
            5. Continue until k becomes 0

        Complexity:
            Time: O(log(n)Â²) where log(n) is the number of digits in n
            Space: O(1), constant extra space

            while curr <= n:
                # Add the count of numbers between curr and min(next_prefix-1, n)
                count += min(n - curr + 1, next_prefix - curr)
                # Move to the next level in the tree
                next_prefix, curr = next_prefix * 10, curr * 10
            return count

        current = 1  # Start from 1 (lexicographically smallest digit)

            subtree_size = count(current)
