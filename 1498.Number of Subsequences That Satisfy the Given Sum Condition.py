        """Two pointers with binary search approach.

        Intuition:
        For each minimum value in a subsequence, we need to find all valid maximum values
        that satisfy min + max â‰¤ target. Since order doesn't matter in subsequences,
        we can sort the array and use binary search to efficiently find these values.

        Approach:
        1. Sort the array to easily identify min and max values
        2. Precompute powers of 2 for subsequence counting
        3. For each potential minimum value, find the maximum valid index using binary search
        4. Calculate number of valid subsequences using 2^(j-i) formula

        Complexity:
        Time: O(n log n) due to sorting and binary search operations
        Space: O(n) for storing powers of 2
