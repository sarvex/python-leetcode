        """BFS Level Order Traversal

        Intuition:
        When viewing a binary tree from the right side, we see the rightmost node at each level.
        This suggests a level-order traversal where we capture the last node at each level.

        Approach:
        1. Use BFS (level-order traversal) with a queue to process nodes level by level
        2. At each level, capture the value of the last node (rightmost node)
        3. Process all nodes at the current level and add their children to the queue

        Complexity:
        Time: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree
        Space: O(w) where w is the maximum width of the tree (worst case O(n/2) â‰ˆ O(n))

                    queue.append(node.left)

                    queue.append(node.right)
