        """Backtracking with bit manipulation for optimal performance

        Intuition:
        The N-Queens II problem requires counting valid configurations where N queens
        can be placed on an NÃ—N chessboard without threatening each other. A queen
        threatens any piece in the same row, column, or diagonal.

        Approach:
        Use backtracking with three sets to track occupied columns and diagonals:
        1. Track occupied columns with a boolean array
        2. Track occupied diagonals (i+j) with another boolean array
        3. Track occupied anti-diagonals (i-j+n) with a third boolean array
        4. Recursively place queens row by row, backtracking when needed

        Complexity:
        Time: O(N!), as we potentially try N positions for the first row, N-1 for the second, etc.
        Space: O(N), for the recursion stack and the three boolean arrays
