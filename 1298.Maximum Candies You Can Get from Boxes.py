        """Iterative approach processing boxes in batches until convergence

        Intuition:
        Instead of tracking processed boxes, we can repeatedly process all available boxes
        in batches until we can't collect any more candies. This approach is simpler and
        eliminates the need for complex tracking data structures.

        Approach:
        1. Start with the initial boxes as our processing queue
        2. Keep track of all keys we've collected
        3. In each iteration:
           - Process boxes we can open (either by status or collected keys)
           - Collect candies, keys, and new boxes
           - Continue until no more candies can be collected

        Complexity:
        Time: O(NÂ²) where N is the total number of boxes (worst case if each iteration only opens one box)
        Space: O(N) for storing keys and the processing queue
