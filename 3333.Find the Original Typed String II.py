    Group-based Dynamic Programming with Inclusion-Exclusion

    Intuition:
    When Alice types a string, each character can be pressed once or multiple times.
    We can group consecutive identical characters and count their frequencies.
    The problem reduces to selecting which groups to keep or merge.

    Approach:
    1. Group consecutive identical characters and count frequencies
    2. If we have enough groups (>= k), all combinations are valid
    3. Otherwise, use inclusion-exclusion principle with DP to count valid strings
    4. Calculate total valid combinations with length >= k

    Complexity:
    - Time: O(n + kÂ²) where n is the length of word and k is the minimum length
    - Space: O(k) for the DP arrays
