        """Optimized approach using index-based overlap calculation

        Intuition: Group indices by their remainder when divided by k, then find the
        maximum length alternating subsequence between pairs of remainder groups.

        Approach:
        1. Group indices of elements by their remainder when divided by k
        2. Calculate the maximum length of a single remainder group
        3. For each pair of remainder groups, calculate the maximum length of alternating subsequence
        4. Return the maximum length found

        Complexity:
        Time: O(n + rÂ²), where n is the length of nums and r is the number of distinct remainders
        Space: O(n) for storing indices grouped by remainder
