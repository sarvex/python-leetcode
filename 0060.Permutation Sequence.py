        """Get the kth permutation sequence of numbers 1 to n.

        Intuition: Use factorial number system to find the kth permutation directly
        without generating all permutations.

        Approach: For each position, calculate which number should be placed based on
        factorial values. Remove the used number from the candidates list and continue
        to the next position with updated k value.

        Complexity:
            Time: O(nÂ²) due to removing elements from the candidates list
            Space: O(n) for storing the result and candidates list

        factorial = 1
        for i in range(1, n):

        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            # Find the index of the number to use at this position
            idx = k // factorial if i > 0 else 0

            # Add the corresponding number to the result
            result.append(str(candidates[idx]))

            # Remove the used number from candidates
            candidates.pop(idx)
