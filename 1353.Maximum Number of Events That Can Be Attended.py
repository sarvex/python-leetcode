        Union-Find (Disjoint Set) based Approach

        Intuition:
        We can model the problem using a Union-Find data structure where each day points to the next
        available day. This helps us efficiently find the earliest available day to attend an event.

        Approach:
        1. Sort events by their end day (earlier end days first)
        2. Use Union-Find to track and update the next available day
        3. For each event, find the earliest available day between its start and end days
        4. If a valid day is found, mark it as used and update the Union-Find structure

        Complexity:
        Time: O(E Î±(D)) where E is the number of events and D is the range of days,
              Î± is the inverse Ackermann function (effectively constant)
        Space: O(D) where D is the maximum end day
        """
        # Sort events by end day to process events that end earlier first
        events.sort(key=lambda e: e[1])

        # Find the maximum end day to initialize the Union-Find array
        max_day = events[-1][1] if events else 0

        # Initialize Union-Find array where parent[i] points to the next available day
        parent = list(range(max_day + 2))  # +2 to handle 1-based indexing and edge cases
