        Intuition:
            For each spell, we need to count potions that create a product â‰¥ success.
            If we sort potions, we can use binary search to efficiently find this count.

        Approach:
            1. Sort the potions array
            2. For each spell, calculate the minimum potion strength needed (success/spell)
            3. Use binary search to find the index of the first potion that meets the requirement
            4. Calculate how many potions are valid (total - index)

        Complexity:
            Time: O(n log m + m log m) where n is len(spells) and m is len(potions)
            Space: O(n) for the result array
        """
        potions.sort()
        m = len(potions)

            # Find index of first potion that works
            idx = bisect_left(potions, min_strength)
